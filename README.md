# Vasudha-Project1
The part of the project I focused on was the Insurance Data set and used it along with the John Hopkins data for counties for confirmed cases and deaths.
The images are saved in Insurance images, the jupyter notebook is  saved in Insurance Jupyter notebook and the csv files are included in the Insurance Data folder
